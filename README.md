# Frontend Technical Test Project

## Overview

This is a modern React-based frontend project built with TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. The project implements a responsive and interactive user interface with smooth animations using GSAP.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19**: Modern UI library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **GSAP**: Professional-grade animation library
- **DaisyUI**: Component library for TailwindCSS
- **React Helmet**: For managing document head
